# Example Program


Basic example program that show cases how to interact with tulip v2 vaults using the SDK. There are some assumptions made about this setup, namely a folder `secrets` with a keyfile `id.json` that is not treed into source. This wallet address is then used to derive variables, often prefixed with `YOUR_XYZ`, either in `Anchor.toml` or within the anchor tests.
